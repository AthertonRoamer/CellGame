CELL GAME PROJECT OVERVIEW

Cell types:
	Mover/Motor Cell-
		...
	Nucleus-
		...
	Algae-
		...
	Gatherer-
		First cell we are making that has its own 'custom' movement mechanics. when clicked on in 
		real time, you can designate a start and end position of its movement loop. It will follow 
		this path by moving one tile at a time. It can gather one algae and also dump it in nucleus
		for power. You can click on the start and end point with your mouse.
	Acid Cell-
		Basically deletes itself and any enemy cell upon contact with enemy cell. Pro to a bomb cell
		because it cannot friendly fire.

Game Cycle:
	REAL TIME STRAT-
		There are no turns, players move and play at same time, HOWEVER, generations take place standardly- meaning that
		generations will continue to go and during a 'move' phase, players cannot place cells. The idea for these phases is 
		to make it almost like a customizable thing for custom games where you can adjust the amount of time these phases take
		before the game starts(almost like a chess game and the chess clock)- this is one of the many ideas for customizable 
		game features. Others include maps, movement speed, etc...
		
		Build Phase-

Optimization: 
	fix process loop running for each cell, if no bugs, no big deal, if still bugs, big deal :)
