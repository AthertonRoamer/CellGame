# a new type of cell we are testing that utilizes custom movement. after being built by a team, you can click
# on this cell and then assign it a custom movement pattern that it can follow, if it goes on top of algae, it will
# gather the algae and if it goes adjacent to a nucleus, it will auto-dump the algae that it is carrying into the nucleus,
# to later be converted to building power by the nucleus.
